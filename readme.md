# JavaScript30 Challenge

I need to improve my vanilla JS skills, so I'm doing the [JavaScript30 challenge](https://javascript30.com/) by [Wes Bos](.

I will not be completing this in 30 days. I've started the project several times, and given up in frustration because inevitably I run out of time to do it properly and feel tempted to just paste the soltuion files, which defeats the purpose of doing the challenge. 

I'm commiting to completing two challenges per week.

**Start Date:** 03/15/2021

(TODO: Look into using Netlify to display final products.)
